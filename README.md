# StarSys
The StarSys programming language made by Masked Idiot on Youtube.

This is StarSys.
The file extension for StarSys is .star.
The sublime build system will come with the language in the "Interpreter" folder.
My channel is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuTHP4ZLkbo3Q4Lt78W-kQA.
Any python module will work with this since it compiles straight to python in "result.py" in the "Interpreter" folder.
Any thing you do in StarSys will require a main function which looks like this:

def main(){
	#body
}

To import a module use the import keyword.
To use exponents use a carot^ instead of two asterisks**
To import certain classes and/or functions from a module use "from (module name) import (class/function, another class/function)"
You can write just plain python in StarSys but then what is the point of "compiling" it.
For if statments, functions, classes, and loops you are going to need curly braces{}
In StarSys you will not be able to do things like print(f"my token is {self.token} because it is my favorite.") because of how the compiler is written.
You are going to need to change the path the .bat (and .sublime-build if you use sublime) file copies the files to so that it will work.
Put the makeStar.bat and StarSys.bat file into your user folder and edit the path in it to make it go to the StarSys interpreter folder where ever you put it.

That is everything you need to know about StarSys.
Everything else in StarSys is the same as in python.
You WILL NEED Python installed on your machine AND python in your PATH.
